# Coding Test for tails.com

## Overview

We're excited to see how you approach building quality software! Think of this as creating an open source project you'd be proud to share on GitHub. 

**Time commitment:** Minimum 90 minutes (feel free to spend more time if you'd like)

**What we're looking for:** High-quality code with great architecture, clear decision-making, and thoughtful implementation.  We value understanding over speed, so avoid frameworks that do all the heavy lifting for you.

**Show us how you think** through clear naming, comments, tests, and architectural choices. 

## Instructions

### 1. Set Up Your Application

Create a Docker container with a Python-based application. We prefer FastAPI, but any framework works. 

### 2. Build Your Features

Choose the track that matches your role:

#### Backend Software Engineer Track

* Render stores from `stores.json` in alphabetical order
* Integrate with [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io) to fetch and display latitude/longitude for each store's postcode
* Build functionality to return stores within a given radius of a UK postcode, ordered north to south. This function should include unit tests.

#### Full Stack Software Engineer Track

**Backend:**
* Create an API that searches stores from `stores.json` (e.g., searching "hav" returns "Newhaven")
* Order results by matching postcode first, then city name (e.g., "br" shows "Orpington" (BR5 3RP) before "Bracknell")
* Include unit tests

**Frontend (using Vue or React preferred):**
* Build a search interface with a text field and results list
* Add type-ahead suggestions with 100ms debounce (minimum 2 characters)
* Display 3 results initially, lazy load more on scroll

### 3. Submit Your Work

* Zip your code (max 10MB) and upload via the "Show Questions" button in your email
* Include a text file with answers to:
  1. Which track did you complete? (backend or full-stack)
  2. What would you do differently with more time?
  3. What was the hardest part?  What are you most proud of?  Why?
  4. How could we improve this test?

Good luck!  We're looking forward to seeing your work.  🚀
